# Simulation of Reflected Brownian motion on two dimensional wedges
[arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02171)

This is the Python code for the algorithms that are described in the paper: simulation of stopped and reflected Brownian motion, simulation of stopped and reflected processes.
The notebook Simulations.ipynb shows how to use the source code rmb.py.
